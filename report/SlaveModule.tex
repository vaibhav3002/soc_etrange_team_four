\section{Generic Slave Module}

As several modules in our design require a slave interface to let the LM32 post to them configuration values, we decided to implement a generic slave interface, that can be easily re-used in every module.

This generic slave modules includes a state machine that handles simple read and write requests, as presented in figure \ref{state_machine_slave}.

When accessing the \emph{Read} or \emph{Write} states, the module automatically calls the \texttt{slave\_read()} and \texttt{slave\_write()} methods respectively.

These methods can be overloaded in any inheriting slave interface, and thus allows a great variety of behaviors and features to rely on one single wishbone slave interface.
