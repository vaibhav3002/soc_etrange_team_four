\section{Introduction} 

This report presents the current state of our project "etrange". This project is part of the System on Chip course at Telecom Paristech.

We will first start by describing the purpose of this project. We will then continue by introducing the overall architecture and explain the different components and their behavior in detail.

Then, in a dedicated section, we will describe the system's mode of operation.

Finally, we will conclude by describing the project's status.
